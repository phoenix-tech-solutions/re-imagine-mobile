# RIR Mobile App

This is a mobile application for the Re-Imagine Robotics program, an educational initiative focused on guiding students through robotics, engineering, and programming.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:phoenix-tech-solutions/re-imagine-mobile.git
    cd re-imagine-robotics-mobile
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies** (although `npm` works, remove `pnpm-lock.yaml` if really needed):
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Expo development server**:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

    This will open a new tab in your browser with the Expo Dev Tools. You can then:
    -   Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone.
    -   Run on an Android emulator or iOS simulator.
    -   Run in a web browser.
